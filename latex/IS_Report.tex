	\section{Bot-Fight Environment}
	For the purposes of the experiments we implemented a game environment we called "Bot-Fight". It consists of a 2D environment with two teams of bots and some obstacles. The idea was to implement different types of agents controlling these bots, which can move around the environment and fire straight forward. The obstacles in the environment could block bullets and prevent bots from moving through them. This game was also human playable. All of these game elements are showcased in Figure
